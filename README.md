# Python Exercises

### Exercise 1: ANAGRAMS
 
Reads from an input file and return the anagram of the words:

How to run:

`python anagrams.py -n [word]`

### Exercise 2: WEEBY NUMBERS
“Webby numbers” are those whose only prime factors are 5, 3 or 2. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24 shows the first 15 “Webby numbers”. Write a python program to print the 1200'th number in the sequence. A good solution should execute in < 1 second.

How to run the script:

`python weeby.py -n [sequence]`

### Exercise 3: SUM
This iterative function returns the sum of elements in a list. Eg. given the list [1,2,3] the function returns 1+2+3 = 6. Rewrite it as a recursive function.

`python sum.py [list of numbers]`

example:
`python sum.py 1, 2`
